Are the values in the HX711 file the correct ones? Is gain definitely 128? Is calibration definitely 120?
I want to compartmentalize as much info as possible, so I'd like to set these values in the .h file for the HX711.

The check_input() function in top.c might not work (pointers are weird with arudino defined ports)
(Josh)

top Makefile is also a bit clunky b/c idk how to force it to compile all the dependent .o files

*** Update: I figured this one out. I just had to make different functions and indices for each menu ***
Problem: I want to be able to use the rotary encoder in multiple different states. How do I differentiate them?
For example, I'd like to use it to scroll on the options menu and to scroll on the sensor data display.

When compiling, you need to "make clean" then "make" (we should figure out how to work this into makefile)

As of 11:38 PM 4/7, all of the code compiles with one warning (i can't fix the warning)
(Josh)

We should figure out a better way to store all the data. Maybe a map of data names to an array of recent readings? idk
(Josh)

Also need to figure out how to handle decimals. How are we storing these values?

As of 10:44 PM 4/8, all of the code compiles with two warnings (they're the same warning and I can't fix it)
