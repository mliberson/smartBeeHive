Are the values in the HX711 file the correct ones? Is gain definitely 128? Is calibration definitely 120?
I want to compartmentalize as much info as possible, so I'd like to set these values in the .h file for the HX711.

top Makefile is also a bit clunky b/c idk how to force it to compile all the dependent .o files
(Josh)

We should figure out a better way to store all the data. Maybe a map of data names to an array of recent readings? idk
(Josh)

Also need to figure out how to handle decimals. How are we storing these values?
(Josh)

We need to input which pins the fans and heaters will be on and adjust the code a bit, but its pretty much done.

    check_input function works for our single button. You sometimes might need to 'make clean' before running 'make' to ensure that old .o files don't have outdated data that will mess up your current compilation. Scroll functionality works well, but its slow. So far, we can see current sensor readings and set our desired temperature and that's about it.
TODO:
    1. Finish the get_'sensor_name_here'_sample() function for each sensor
    2. Decide how to store data
    3. Implement EEPROM functionality into top level code
    4. Try to make the LCD writing faster (idk why its so slow but its lowkey very annoying)
    5. Create a physical container for the whole system to get a concept for how it would actually look
    6. Bigger goals
        6a. mini-AI to get more consistent honey output or less colony loss somehow?
        6b. figure out what else this data is good for (I think the temperature data can be very valuable)
        6c. maybe we should add internet functionality (probably time consuming but could be very interesting)
        6d. ?
