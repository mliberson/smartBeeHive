# The Hive

The Hive is a semi-autonomous beehive design to make life easier for apiarists and their bees. It consists of several sensors used to track the environmental conditions surrounding the hive. Using this data along with user input, The Hive is able to control the internal temperature, alert the user to suspicious sensor readings, and calculate locally optimal conditions. See the Final Report for more information.
